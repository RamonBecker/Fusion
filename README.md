# Fusion
## :information_source: Information 

The fusion project was developed during the web programming course with the Django framework promoted by Geek University. Ready-made templates were used and the back end of the application was programmed. Django's translation functionality was used and finally unit tests were performed. In order to register employees, positions and services, it is necessary to enter the admin panel of Django.
